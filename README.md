# yannkins

A simple continuous integration program for Linux server. It need cron to launch basics tasks and create a nice html page to show results. An additionnal web server is needed if you want a network access.

## What is Yannkins ?

Yannkins is a project which aim is to provide easy continuous integration service for Linux. I plan to make it work with cron and a web server, for example Apache httpd.
Projects will be configured in text files located in directory `${YANNKINS_DIR}/projects/`.
One cron task will perform projects analysis : svn checkout/update or git clone/pull, compilation, units tests, ... defined in projects' configuration files. After the analysis are executed, an other program will generate HTML reports with the logs of the analysis. 

## What is already available ?

The project is just beginning, so is not still completed.
For now there is only the program "cree_page" to create the html report pages. It is not usable lonely because this program needs the logs of the tasks to generate the report.
In the present version this logs may be generate by scripts shell located in the bin directory on yannkins repository.
Only SVN is supported, but support for git is in the roadmap.

## How to get started ?

**First download the source code**

> git clone https://github.com/thaddeus002/yannkins.git

**Compile source**

> cd yannkins; make; make install

**Configure a project**

Define a environment variable YANNKINS_HOME to point to the working directory for Yannkins.
Create directories `${YANNKINS_HOME}/projets`, `${YANNKINS_HOME}/log`, `${YANNKINS_HOME}/svn`, and `${YANNKINS_HOME}/www`. This last can be a symbilic link to `/var/www/html`.
Then create a file describing your project. Your can inspire yourself with the example `yannkins/projects/fheroes2` in yannkins' repository.

**Launch the analyse**

Launch the script `analyse.sh`.

**View the results**

A the end of analyse, you must find html files in `${YANNKINS_HOME}/www`. Open index.html in a browser to acces the list of yours projects, with links to projects' pages.
If this process completes succefully, you may want to put the task `/usr/local/bin/analyse.sh` in a crontab to execute it automatically.

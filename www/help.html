<p>To create a project, you simply have to add a new file in the directory "projets".
This file must content the following fields :
<ul>
<li>PROJECT_NAME : name of the project
<li>SVN_DEPOT or GIT_DEPOT : URL of the project's repository
<li>SVN_USER or GIT_USER : SVN or GIT authentification user - may be empty
<li>SVN_PASSWD or GIT_PASSWD: authentification password - may be empty
<li>COMPIL : compilation command
<li>TESTS_UNI : units tests command
</ul>
The lines beginning with '#' are commentaries.
</p>

<p>
The "analyse.sh" command launch the analysis of all projects, and the update of "index.html"
and of the pages of the projects. You can put this command in a cron task to automatically
execute it every day at a selected hour. But you also can launch it manually. The html reports
can then be see locally or via a web server.
